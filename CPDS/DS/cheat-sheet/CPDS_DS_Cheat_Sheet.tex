    \textbf{Chandy Lamport Snapshot Algorithm}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Initiator process:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Record its own state.
            \item Send a \textbf{special marker} on every outgoing channel.
            \item Record incoming messages until marker received.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item When receiving a marker (if process has not recorded its own state)
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Record own state
            \item Send marker through outgoing channels
            \item Start recording over incoming channels.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Otherwise finalize state of incoming channel.
    \end{itemize}


    \textbf{Lin's Voting Algorithm}
    
    Decentralized algorithm with \textbf{N coordinators}.
    Using \textbf{voting}, gain quorum from the coordinators.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Process sends \textbf{Request} to each coordinator: including Lamport's clock and ID.
        \item Coordinator grants vote if it has not voted yet (otherwise queue request) and send \textbf{Response} w/ current vote.
        \item Requester analyzes votes in responses: if majority accesses section, if someone else majority waits. Else, either releases and backs off, or sends \textbf{yield} (release + request).
        \item On receiving a \textbf{yield} a coordinator removes its vote, queues request and sends response.
        \item When the process exists the critical section sends a \textbf{release} message.
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Ricart \& Agrawala's Voting Algorithm}

    Multicast with logical clocks.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Process sends \textbf{Request} to all other processes.
        \item When requester receives \textbf{OK} from all processes, it can access the critical section.
        \item When a process receives a \textbf{Request}: if not accessing send \textbf{OK}, if accessing now queue, if wants to access decide basing on clock + PID.
    \end{enumerate}
    Variant (\textbf{Maekawa's Algorithm}): get permission to access CS by obtaining votes from a \textbf{subset} of the rest of the processes.
    All voting sets have the same size $K$, and each $p_i$ belongs to $M$ voting sets, and is ruled by just one (opt. at $K = M \simeq \sqrt{N}$).

    \textbf{Bully Election Algorithm}

    Synchronous system and reliable message delivery.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item P sends an \textbf{Election} message to all the processes with higher IDs and waits for \textbf{OK} messages.
        \item If a process receives an \textbf{Election} message, returns \textbf{OK} and starts another election.
        \item If P receives an \textbf{OK} it drops out the election and awaits a \textbf{Coordinator} message.
        \item If P does not receive any \textbf{OK} before the timeout (synchronous system), it wins and sens a \textbf{Coordinator} message.
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Chang and Roberts' Ring Election Algorithm}

    Processes are organized by ID in a logical unidirectional ring (each process knows its successor), asynchronous system.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item P sends an \textbf{Election} message (with its ID) to its successor, and becomes a participant.
        \item On receiving an \textbf{Election}, Q compares the ID in the message with its own: if greater Q forwards the message, if smaller Q replaces the ID with its own and becomes a participant (unless it already is, in which case it drops the message). If the ID is the same, Q wins and sends a \textbf{Coordinator} message.
        \item When Q receives a \textbf{Coordinator} message, it forwards it and becomes a non-participant.
    \end{enumerate}
    What happens when a process crashes? We make use of the \textbf{Enhanced Ring Algorithm}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item P sends an \textbf{Election} message to its closest alive successor.
        \item At each step, each process adds its ID to the list in the message.
        \item When the message gets back to the initiator (first PID) it elects the highest ID in the list and sends a \textbf{Coordinator} with this ID.
        \item When relaying, each process adds its ID to the list, if when finished the elected process ID is in the list, election is over.
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Basic Reliable Multicast}

    Assume process do not fail and do not join/leave the group.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Sender $P$ assigns a sequence number to each outgoing message, and stores a copy until everyone has acked.
        \item Each process $Q$ records the number of the \textbf{last message it has delivered} coming from any other process $P$, $L_Q(P)$.
        \item When $Q$ receives a message from $P$: if $S_P = L_Q(P) + 1$ it delivers the message, increase counter, and ack $P$, if it is greater, keeps message in queue and requests RTX of missing elements, otherwise it discards the message.
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Scalable Reliable Multicast}

    Use sequence numbers but \textbf{reduce} the number of feedback messages to the sender.
    Only missing messages are reported.
    Each process waits a random delay prior to sending a NACK, and if they receive one, they discard theirs.

    \textbf{Ordered Multicast}

    Due to latency, messages might arrive in different order at different nodes.
    Common ordering requirements: FIFO (preserve intra-process order), causal (happened-before relation), total (all process deliver in same order).
    In order to implement it:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{FIFO:} Use \textbf{sequence numbers per sender} and hold-back queue for out-of-order messages.
        \item \textbf{Total:} either use a centralized sequencer to give a total ordering, or by agreement of the processes:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Sender multicasts message $m$.
            \item Each receiver $j$ replies with a proposed message number $P_j = \max(A_j, P_j) = \max(\text{ largest agreed }, \text{ own largest proposed })$.
            \item Sender selects the largest proposal $N$ and multicasts it.
            \item Receiver $j$ updates $A_j$ and reorders messages in the queue.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Causal:} delivered only if all causally preceedin messages have been delivered.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $P_i$ increases $VC_i[i]$ only when sending a message.
            \item If $P_j$ receives $m$ from $P_i$ it postpones delivery until: $ts(m)[i] = VC_j[i] + 1$ and $ts(m)[k] \leq VC_j[k] \forall k \neq i$.
            \item $P_j$ increases $VC_j[i]$ after delivering $m$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Dolev \& Strong's Consensus Algorithm}

    Crash-faulty processes and reliable communication in a synchronous system.
    Up to $f$ of the $N$ processes exhibit crash failures.
    Algorithm proceeds in $f+1$ rounds:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Each process proposes a value.
        \item From round $1$ to round $f+1$ each process:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Multicasts NEW values. Initially send its proposed value.
            \item Collects vales from other processes. (Round terminates when values from all processes are collected or by timeout).
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Each process decides against collected values.
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{OM(m) Consensus Algorithm}

    Byzantine-faulty processes and reliable communication in a synchronous system.
    At most $m$ traitors and at least $3m + 1$ generals.
    It requires $m+1$ rounds.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{OM(0)}: the commander sends his value to every lieutenant, each lieutenant accepts the value he receives as the order.
        \item \textbf{OM(m), $m > 0$}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The commander sends his value to every lieutenant.
            \item Each lieutenant $i$ acts as a commander in $OM(m-1)$ and broadcasts the value he got from the commander to the $n-2$ remaining lieutenants.
            \item Each lieutenant $i$ accepts the value $\text{majority}(v_1, \dots, v_{n-1})$ where $i$ is the directly received value, and the rest are the broadcasted values.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Strict Two-Phase Locking}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item When a R/W operation accesses an object within a TX:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If the object not locked, it is locked and proceeds.
            \item If (non-)conflicting lock, (not )wait until unlocked.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item When transaction commits: server releases all locks.
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Timestamp Ordering}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $T$ performs a \textbf{W} (creates new tentative version) if:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $T \geq \text{ max. R TS} \quad \&\& $
            \item $T \geq \text{ W TS on commited version}$.
        \end{itemize}
        \item $T$ performs a \textbf{R} if object last written by an earlier transaction.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Directed to version w/ maximum W TS.
            \item If tentative TS, $T$ must wait.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Two-Phase Commit Protocol (2PC)}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Coordinator sends \textbf{Vote-Request} to all participants.
        \item Participant replies: \textbf{Vote-Commit} or \textbf{Vote-Abort}
        \item If all commit, send \textbf{Global-Commit} abort otherwise.
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Data-Centric Strong Consistency Models}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Strict:} all processes see the result of the most recent write.
        \item \textbf{Linearizability:} all processes see same interleaving of operations ordered according to a global timestamp.
        \item \textbf{Sequential:} all processes see the same interleaving of operations, but not ordered in time.
        \item \textbf{Causal:} all processes see causally-related operations in the same order.
        \item \textbf{FIFO:} all processes see operations from each other in the order they were issued.
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Client-Centric Consistency Models}

    We keep track of a \textbf{Read Set} (writes relevant for the read operations) and a \textbf{Write Set} (writes performed by that client).
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Read Your Writes:} if client $C$ writes $x$ on replica $A$, successive reads on $x$ on replica $B$ will return the written value or a more recent one.
        \item \textbf{Monotonic Reads:} if client $C$ reads $x$ on replica $A$, any successive read on $x$ by $C$ will return the same value or a more recent one.
        \item \textbf{Monotonic Writes:} a write by $C$ on $x$ on replica $A$ is completed also in replica $B$ before $C$ performs a successive write on $B$.
        \item \textbf{Writes Follow Reads:} a write by a process is ordered after any writes whose effects were seen by previous reads of that process.
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Primary-Based Protocols}

    Each data item is associated with a \textbf{primary replica} in charge of coordinating write operations.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Primary-Backup Remote-Write Protocols:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item All writes done at a fixed replica, local reads.
            \item Either blocking or non-blocking writes.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Primary-Backup Local-Write Protocols:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Primary \textbf{migrates} to the replica that is writing.
            \item Replicas updated using a non-blocking protocol.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Replicated-Write Protocols}

    Writes can be carried out at \textbf{multiple replicas}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Active Replication:} each operation is forwarded to \textbf{all} replicas.
        \item \textbf{Quorum-based:} permission from a quorum of $N$ replicas before either reading or writing.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Read quorum of $N_R$ replicas before reading.
            \item Write quorum of $N_W$ replicas before writing.
        \end{itemize}
        \item $N_R + N_W > N$ to avoid read-write conflicts.
        \item $N_W > \frac{N}{2}$ to avoid write-write conflicts.
        \item Correct choice, read one, write all.
        \item Read operations return the last value written.
    \end{itemize}
