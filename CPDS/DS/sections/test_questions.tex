\subsection{Usual Test Questions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Maekawa's Algorithm may can violate the liveness property.
    \item Total Ordering does not necessarily fulfill the program order of each sender.
    \item Failure Detectors work only in synchronous systems.
    \item Message Passing does not space-decouple sender and receiver.
    \item Paxos cannot guarantee termination (liveness).
    \item Group communication is an indirect communication paradigm.
    \item Strong consistency models provide a system-wide consistent view of the data with a granularity of individual operations on data stores with concurrent writes.
\end{itemize}
