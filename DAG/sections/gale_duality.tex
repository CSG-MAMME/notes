\subsection{Oriented Matroid and Gale Duality Construction}

\begin{definition}[Polyhedron]
    A \textit{polyhedron} in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is any set obtained as the intersection of finitely many halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
    Mathematically, it has the form $P = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^d: Ax \leq b \}$ where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times d}$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}^m$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Polytope]
    A \textit{polytope} is a bounded polyhedron.
    Alternatively, a \textit{polytope} in $\R^d$ is the convex hull of a finite number of points.
    These points are its \textit{vertices}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Simplices]
    The simplest polytopes are \textit{simplices}.
    The unit $(d-1)$-simplex is defined as $\Delta_{d-1} \coloneqq \text{conv}(\{\pmb{e_1}, \dots, \pmb{e_d}\}) = \{ \pmb{x} \in \R^d : x_1 + \dots + x_d = 1, x_i \geq 0 \}$.
    This family includes a line segment, triangle, and tetrahedron.
\end{definition}
